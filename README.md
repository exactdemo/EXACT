Attributed entity is an entity defined by its structural attributes. It is the generalization of the well-known named entity. Extracting attributed entities from textual documents is an important problem for a variety of big-data applications. We propose a novel system called EXACT for extracting attributed entities from large collection of textual documents without prior specification of the schemas. By iteratively performing explorative annotation tasks, which allow users to create attributes, bind values, and link the documents to the values, the system is able to build schemas and extract entities for the dataset at limited cost in human annotation.  We demonstrate the novel techniques supporting productive and efficient extraction of attributed entities from large document collections.
